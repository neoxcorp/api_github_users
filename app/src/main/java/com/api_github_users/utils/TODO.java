/*
    github.com has public API to get list of users https://api.github.com/users.
    There are helpfull parameters like per_page and since, check them.
    You need to create android application, which allows to get list of github users loaded into ListView.
    Each row contains login, profile link (html_url) and avatar preview(100x100).
    Clicking on avatar preview should result in opening bigger avatar version (about 400x400)

    We expect application will:

            - Allow to browse at least first 300 users ( more - is better, lazy loading is a big plus).
            - Implement some kind of image caching.
            - Show some kind of progress indicator if user waits for background task to complete,
                but do not block user interaction with application.
            - Allow Activity recreation during configuration change (like orientation change).
